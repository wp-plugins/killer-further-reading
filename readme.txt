Killer further reading recommends content to user based on a tag and excludes already visited content.

== Description ==

The plugin adds a widget named Killer Further Reading in your Wordpress widget area and recommends content based on a tag you specify in the widget settings. The killer part is it excludes posts that are already visited by the user. The tracking is done based on cookies and so if you are using the plugin, you may need to include about cookies in privacy notice for your blog.

For blogs that aren't too general, every content is more or less related and so the idea is to show the best or evergreen content for further reading than those that is not as good as those but is more related to what user is reading.

Other further reading plugins just show the best or most popular articles based on tag or category of the article you are currently on but that may not always be the best content of the blog. So if you have a better article from other category but is one of the best resource of your blog, it makes much more sense to be showing that content rather. The killer part helps avoiding the content that is already viewed once and so you can suggest more and more of your best content as the process of reading continues.
